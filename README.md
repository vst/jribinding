# Java/R Binding Convenience

`jribinding` is a convenience wrapper around
[JRI](https://rforge.net/JRI/) of [rJava](https://rforge.net/rJava/).

There are a few other ways to use R from within Java. They all have
their own advantages and disadvantages. This very library focuses on
convenience of using JRI Engine backend of REngine as it is the most
efficient way to execute R statements on a full fledged R environment.

Having said that, you might want to look at
[Renjin](http://www.renjin.org/) and even support it as I believe it
is (will be) the most elegant way to incorporate R into a Java
enviroment once they succeed.
